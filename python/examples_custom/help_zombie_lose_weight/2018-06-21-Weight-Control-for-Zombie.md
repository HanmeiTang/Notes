Zombie is over-wighted, according to the introduction given by the Boston Cat Hospital [$^{[1]}$](http://www.thebostoncathospital.com/feline-fast-facts.pml):

> In the majority of domestic cats, the average weight of the adult un-neutered male (tom) is 8.6 pounds, compared with 7.2 pounds for the un-spayed female (queen)

The obesity situation was also warned by Humane Society staff and his vet. BTW, Mei weighs 9.7 lbs today.

This figure tracks his weight over time. To update:
```bash
$ cd /Users/hanmeiTang/repos/hatGit/cat

# After updating weight.csv
$ ./plot_weight
```
